I decided to restart my journey with Python from scratch 'cause I'm feeling a little rusty at coding and I'll be documenting it here. 🤓🖥️🐍

I'm currently following the Angela Yu's course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) as well as trying to do some other challenges myself too.
