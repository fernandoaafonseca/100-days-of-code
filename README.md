My main objective in this repository is not only to complete the challenges but to add some new ideas and explore the power of Python whenever possible.

I spent several months without coding because I was out of time, so I decided to restart my journey with Python from scratch. 🤓🖥️🐍

I'm currently following the Angela Yu's course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) and trying to do some other challenges too.
